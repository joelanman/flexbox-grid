# Flexbox Grid

Use Flexbox with `justify-content: space-around` to make a grid that expands nicely to fill the screen.

If the last row has fewer items than the others, it won't line up, as Flexbox is spreading fewer elements out to fill the screen.

This is a bit of JavaScript to add extra spacer elements to make the last row line up with the ones above.
